# Looki75 Product Sans Font

## Why this module? ##
This is a module to install Google Sans font (aka Product Sans) systemlessly through Magisk.
You say: "Yet another Google Sans module"
Well sure, except that I made an important correction in the font design, read below...

The issue is that when you place a digit before a linebreak, if you click at the end of the line, the cursor is shown in the middle of the digit (see xda thread for screenshot).
All modules I could ever find had the same glitch...

So I corrected this issue and now it is working perfect in my module!!!
Also I corrected the colon for the lockscreen time.
